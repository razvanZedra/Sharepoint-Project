/**
 * This abstract class implements the the base functionality for a client-side web part. Every client-side web part
 * needs to inherit from this class.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Along with the base functionality, this class provides some APIs that can be
 * used by the web part. These APIs fall in two catagories.
 *
 * The first category of APIs provide data and functionality. Example, the web part context (i.e. this.context). This
 * API should be used to access contextual data relevant to this web part instance.
 *
 * The second category of APIs provide a base implementation for the web part lifecycle and can be overridden for an
 * updated implementation. The render() API is the only API that is mandatory to be implemented/overridden by a web
 * part. All other life cycle APIs have a base implementation and can be overridden based on the needs of the web part.
 * Please refer to the documentation of the individual APIs to make the right decision.

 * You can make combinations of these operators, for example `person.websites[*].url`
 *
 * Important Note: Only one wildcard per path is supported.
 *
 * Example: Let's assume we have a web part with properties that have the following schema:
 * ```
 * {
 *   title: string;
 *   person: {
 *     name: string;
 *     bio: string;
 *     photoURLs: string[];
 *     websites: { title: string; url: string; }[]
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * We can define the metadata for the desired properties as following:
 * ```
 * {
 *  'person.bio': { isRichContent: true },
 *  'person.photoURLs[*]': { isImageSource: true },
 *  'person.websites[*].url': { isLink: true }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This will make SharePoint servers aware of the content of your properties and run services such as search indexing,
 * link fix-up, etc on the data. In case any of the values needs to update by these services, e.g link fix-up, the
 * web part property bag is automatically updated.
